This project explores the use of agentic workflows in cybersecurity, with a particular focus on 
phishing detection. Traditional detection methods often rely on large, static datasets and
computationally expensive models, making them costly and inaccessible for many organisations.
Additionally, most existing solutions operate as black boxes, offering little transparency or user
involvement, missing an opportunity to educate and assist users in identifying threats.
To address these limitations, this project introduces a novel, low-cost phishing detection system
built around recent advancements in agent-based architectures. The system combines email
classification using models such as fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA with decision-making processes
driven by cutting-edge large language models like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Mistral. These agents can
access external resources, analysing contextual information from user email history, and presenting
a clear assessment of phishing likelihood to the user, promoting both real-time protection and user
training.

The system achieved 98% accuracy on the classification validation dataset and demonstrated strong
performance in practical scenarios, with seamless integration into platforms like Outlook. The
findings highlight the potential of agentic workflows to transform cybersecurity workflows through
lightweight, scalable solutions, especially as edge-capable LLMs continue to advance. However, the
project also identifies significant challenges, particularly around prompt injection attacks and agent
reliability, emphasising the need for robust control mechanisms to ensure consistent task alignment
and system safety.
